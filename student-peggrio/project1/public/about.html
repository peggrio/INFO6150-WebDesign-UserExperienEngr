                <h2>Betta Fish</h2>
                <p>The <span class="to__bold">Siamese fighting fish </span>(Betta splendens), commonly known as
                    the
                    betta, is a freshwater fish native
                    to Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>Bettas are well known for being highly territorial, with males prone to attacking each other
                    if
                    housed in the same tank; without a means of escape, this will usually result in the death of
                    one
                    or
                    both fish. Female bettas can also become territorial towards one another in confined spaces.
                    Bettas
                    are exceptionally tolerant of low oxygen levels and poor water quality, owing to their
                    special
                    labyrinth organ, a characteristic unique to the suborder Anabantoidei that allows for the
                    intake
                    of surface air.</p>

                <h2>About the Color</h2>
                <p>Wild bettas exhibit strong colours only when agitated. Over the centuries, breeders have been
                    able to
                    make this coloration permanent, and a wide variety of hues breed true. Colours among captive
                    bettas
                    include red, orange, yellow, blue, steel blue, turquoise/green, black, pastel, opaque white, and
                    multi-coloured.</p>

                <p>The betta's diverse colours are due to different layers of pigmentation in their skin. The
                    layers,
                    from deepest within to the outermost, consists of red, yellow, black, iridescent (blue and
                    green),
                    and metallic (not a colour itself, but reacts with the other colours). Any combination of these
                    layers can be present, leading to a wide variety of colours within and among bettas.</p>
